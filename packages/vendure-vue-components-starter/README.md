# Vendure Vue Comoponents Starter

This is an example of how to use the components from `vendure-vue-components`. This example uses gridsome, but the
components also work with Nuxt or just vanilla Vue.

1. `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Create a .env file with the following contents:
```dotenv
GRIDSOME_VENDURE_API=https://your-vendure-server/shop-api
GRIDSOME_VENDURE_TOKEN=channel-token
```
3. `yarn gridsome develop`
